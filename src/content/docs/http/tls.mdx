By default, all certificates are issued by the Local pmesh certificate authority (CA).
This is usually good enough for development, testing, as well as for production deployments where the server is behind another server, for instance Cloudflare.

However, in some cases, you may want to BYOC (Bring Your Own Certificate) or issue certificates automatically using an ACME server like Let's Encrypt.

## BYOC (Bring Your Own Certificate)

To use your own certificate files, you have to use the `certs` section under your virtual host. The `certs` section is a map of domain names to certificate details.
The certificate files must be in PEM format.

You can find an example below:

```yaml
server:
  myapp.com, myapp.local:
    certs:
      myapp.com:
        cert: "/path/to/cert"
        key: "/path/to/key"
    router:
      - return 200 "hello"
```

## Let's Encrypt

Currently, pmesh only supports ACME v2 via Let's Encrypt, and it only supports the TLS-ALPN-01 challenge.
To use Let's Encrypt, you define a certs section similar to the BYOC example, but instead of specifying the certificate and key files, you specify `cert: letsencrypt`.

```yaml
server:
  myapp.com, myapp.local:
    certs:
      myapp.com:
        cert: letsencrypt
    router:
      - return 200 "hello"
```
