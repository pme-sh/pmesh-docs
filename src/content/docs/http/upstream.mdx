Integrating pmesh into your existing service is straightforward and painless.
pmesh moves the responsibility of assigning ports and managing the lifecycle of your services from the service itself to the reverse-proxy.

## Upstream Configuration

pmesh will set three environment variables to inform the service about the host and port it should listen on.
By default these are `HOST`, `PORT`, and `LISTEN`, but they can be customized in the `pm3.yml` file as shown in the [Primitives](/services/primitives/#env_host-and-env_port-env_listen) section.

- `HOST` is the host the service should listen on. ex: `127.2.0.13`
- `PORT` is the port the service should listen on. ex: `70`
- `LISTEN` is the combination of `HOST` and `PORT` in the form `HOST:PORT`. ex: `127.2.0.13:70`

## Special headers

pmesh will also set some special headers to inform the service about the original request.

`P-` prefix is used for the request headers sent to the service.
`X-` prefix is used for the response (or shared) headers where we should conform to the standard custom header naming convention.

- **X-Ray**: is the trace id of the request. ex: `0057b2440ed282da-MYH`
- **P-Asn**: is the ASN of the client. ex: `AS15169 GOOGLE`
- **P-Ip**: is the original IP of the request. ex: `8.8.8.8`
- **P-Ip-Geo**: is the geo location of the original IP of the request. ex: `US`
- **P-Marked**: is set to `1` if the request is marked by the ASN list specified in the manifest.
- **P-Cf**: is set to `1` if the request is coming from Cloudflare.
- **P-Vpn**: is set to `1` if the request is coming from a VPN.
- **P-Internal**: is a boolean indicating if the request is internal or not. ex: `1`
- **P-Portal**: is set to `1` if the request is coming from the portal directive.

`X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` will also be set conforming to [RFC 7239](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239).

## Special response codes

Similar to `nginx`, pmesh will treat the following response codes as special:

- `444` will be treated as a special code to close the connection without sending a response.
