The pmesh load balancer allows you to configure the load balancing strategy, the session kind, the retry policy, and the error handling for 4xx, 5xx, and 404 responses.

```yaml
retry:
  attempts: 3
  backoff: 1s
  timeout: 10s
strat: round-robin
state: sticky
404:
  limit: 1/s block_after=2/s block_for=10m
  handle:
    - log "hi"
4xx:
  handle:
    - log "bad user! bad!"
5xx:
  handle:
    - log "bad server!"
```

## Retry Policy | `retry`

- **Type**: `object`
- **Default**: `{ attempts: 8, backoff: 500ms, timeout: 30s }`

The `retry` field is an object that defines the retry policy for the app.

```yaml
retry:
  attempts: 3
  backoff: 1s
  timeout: 10s
```

The `attempts` field is the number of attempts to make before giving up, the `backoff` field is the initial backoff time, and the `timeout` field is the maximum time to wait for the app to become ready.

This is used to handle the case where the app crashes or fails to start, and pmesh will attempt to restart it a few times before giving up.

The `backoff` time is exponentially increased with each attempt.

## Load Balancing Strategy | `strat`

- **Type**: `least | random | round-robin | hash`
- **Default**: `round-robin`

The `strat` field is a string that defines the load balancing strategy for the app.

The available strategies are:

- `least`: The least connections strategy.
- `random`: The random strategy.
- `round-robin`: The round-robin strategy.
- `hash`: The hash strategy.

## State Kind | `state`

- **Type**: `sticky | none`
- **Default**: `sticky`

The `state` field is a string that defines the session kind for the app, which can be either `sticky` or `none`.

For the `sticky` session kind, pmesh will use the same backend for the same client, whereas for the `none` session kind, pmesh will pick a random backend for each request.

If a retriable error occurs during the handling of a request, pmesh will ignore the sticky session and pick a new upstream.

## Error Handling | `4xx`, `5xx`, `404`

- **Type**: `object?`
- **Default**: `null`

The `4xx`, `5xx`, and `404` fields are objects that define the error handling for 4xx, 5xx, and 404 responses.

If the `limit` field is set, pmesh will rate limit the error responses, for example if the user is sending too many requests,
that are resulting in 404 responses, pmesh can block the user for a certain amount of time to prevent abuse.

The `handle` field can be used to define an optional router that will handle the error responses.
If this router, explicitly drops the request, pmesh will not retry the request, and will return the error response to the client.
Otherwise, if the request is not completed within the router, it will be retried according to the retry policy.
