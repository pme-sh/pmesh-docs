Aside from the implicitly defined runners, we can also define our own subscribers in the manifest file.

```yaml title="pm3.yaml"
runners:
  # The topic
  greet.:
    # Routing of the message
    route:
      - my-api
    # Configuration of the subscriber
    no_dead_letter: false
    rate: 1/s
    # Scheduled runs
    schedule:
      - interval: 1s
        topic: greet.hi
        payload: { "name": "John" }
```

## Route configuration | `route`

- **Type**: [`Mux`](/routing/mux)

The `route` field is used to define the routing of the message. It can contain essentially anything the HTTP router can.

## Subscriber configuration

### `no_dead_letter`

- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Default**: `false`

If set to `true`, the service will not save the error message to the dead letter queue for durable messages.

### `rate`

- **Type**: `string?`
- **Default**: `none`

The rate limiter for the runner. It can be set to a number followed by a unit, such as `1/s`, `h`, etc.
Beyond this limit, the runner will stop polling for messages, and will resume after the rate limit is reset.

### `schedule`

- **Type**: `{ interval: string, topic: string, payload: any }[]`
- **Default**: `none`

The schedule for the runner. It can be set to a list of objects, each containing an `interval`, `topic`, and `payload` field.
The `interval` field is a string that represents the interval of the schedule, and the `topic` and `payload` fields are the topic and payload to be sent to the runner.

When multiple nodes are running, the schedule will not be duplicated, instead one node will be responsible for scheduling the tick, by acquiring a distributed lock, and release it after the tick.

## Responses

Any response returned from the HTTP endpoint will be the response sent to the NATS server, including the headers.
The status code, will be set as a header, `Status`, and the body will be sent as the payload.

For handling errors, 4xx excluding 404 will be considered aborting client errors (since 404 means the subscription is faulty), and 5xx will be considered retriable server errors.

For a comprehensive explanation of how each response is handled, you can refer to the table below.

| Response            | Jetstream                | Core NATS  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Empty 2xx, 202, 204 | Not saved                | Body sent  |
| 2xx with body       | Saves the result         | Body sent  |
| 4xx, except 404     | Saves the error<b>\*</b> | Error sent |
| 404                 | Retry                    | Error sent |
| 5xx                 | Retry                    | Error sent |

\* Unless `no_dead_letter` is set to `true` in the service's configuration.
