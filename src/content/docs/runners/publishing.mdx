pmesh by default uses the `ev` stream for events to ensure durability by default, meaning any subject name provided will be prefixed with `ev.` before being emitted to the NATS server.

For more advanced use cases, you can use the `raw.` prefix to disable this behaviour and publish messages to any NATS subject name as is.

## Publishing a message

For convenience, pmesh provides an API to publish messages to the NATS server, available at the `/publish/:topic` endpoint.
The request body and headers are directly forwarded to the NATS server as a message.

Although it will be explored in more detail later, the most simple way of making internal requests to pmesh is via HTTP using the hostname `pm3`.
For this endpoint, the full URL would be `http://pm3/publish/topic`.

Since we have a project with a `my-api` service, we can actually start publishing messages and receiving responses right away without defining any runners.

First let's define a POST route in our project.

```typescript title="app.ts"
fastify.post("/greet/:id", function (request, reply) {
	for (const key in request.headers) {
		console.log(key, request.headers[key]);
	}
	reply.send({ id: request.params.id });
});
```

Now we can simply use `curl` to send a request to the pmesh instance.

```bash
$ curl http://pm3/publish/svc.my-api.greet.hello
{"stream":"ev", "seq":5189}
```

The logs will show the original request headers, as well as the message queue state.

```bash
# Initial request headers
6:30AM INF │ my-api       host worker
6:30AM INF │ my-api       user-agent curl/8.4.0
6:30AM INF │ my-api       content-length 0
6:30AM INF │ my-api       accept */*
6:30AM INF │ my-api       x-forwarded-for 127.0.0.1
6:30AM INF │ my-api       x-forwarded-proto http
6:30AM INF │ my-api       x-ray 0055449e85d28dfe-MYH
6:30AM INF │ my-api       p-asn AS0 Local
6:30AM INF │ my-api       p-internal 1
6:30AM INF │ my-api       p-ip 127.0.0.1
6:30AM INF │ my-api       p-ip-geo XX
# The consumer queue ID
6:30AM INF │ my-api       c-id run-ev-svc-my-api-all
# Number of messages pending delivery in the consumer queue
6:30AM INF │ my-api       c-pending 0
# Consumer sequence number
6:30AM INF │ my-api       c-seq 10
# Delivery attempt counter
6:30AM INF │ my-api       c-attempt 0
# Stream timestamp for when the message was received
6:30AM INF │ my-api       s-time 1709789441559
# Stream domain
6:30AM INF │ my-api       s-domain
# Stream ID
6:30AM INF │ my-api       s-id ev
# Stream sequence number
6:30AM INF │ my-api       s-seq 5189
```

For each service in the manifest, there is also a corresponding implicit runner that subscribes to the `svc.<name>.>` and `raw.svc.<name>.>` subjects and forwards the messages to the service's HTTP implementation, replacing the `.` delimiter with `/` to form a path.

## Receiving a response

> Cool, but where's our response?

Once the request is finished, if the message originates from a stream,, pmesh will store the response in a special key-value store, which is also convieniently exposed as an endpoint at `/result/:stream/:seq`.

You can think of what we received earlier as a _promise_.

```bash
$ curl http://pm3/result/ev/5189
{"id":"hello"}
```

We could also use the `raw.` prefix to publish a regular NATS message, where the response will be directly sent back to us as a reply.

```bash
$ curl http://pm3/publish/raw.svc.my-api.greet.hello
{"id":"hello"}
```

Similarly, we can use the `nats` CLI to send these requests.

```bash

$ nats request svc.my-api.greet.hello ""
07:11:21 Sending request on "svc.my-api.greet.hello"
07:11:21 Received with rtt 1.1784ms
{"id":"hello"}

$ nats request ev.svc.my-api.greet.hello ""
07:12:04 Sending request on "ev.svc.my-api.greet.hello"
07:12:04 Received with rtt 582.3µs
{"stream":"ev", "seq":5191}

$ nats kv get results ev-5191
results > ev-5191 revision: 12 created @ 07 Mar 24 06:12 UTC

{"id":"hello"}
```
