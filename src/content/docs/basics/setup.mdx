The `pmesh setup` command is used to configure the network settings for the node. This can be used to setup any kind of topology, from a single node to a full mesh. You will need to run this command before starting the server for the first time.

## Node types

If you are running a local development server, you will want to create a seed server since you are the first node in the network, but for the production server, there are many options to choose from.

import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Seed server" icon="star">
		`pmesh setup seed`
		<p>
			Used for your very first server, it will be used to bootstrap the network as the first leader of the RAFT
			topology.
		</p>
	</Card>
	<Card title="Full node" icon="moon">
		`pmesh setup join`
		<p>
			Full member of a mesh similar to a seed server, but it needs to join an existing mesh. Typically this should be
			used for long-running servers as they can be elected as the leader.
		</p>
	</Card>
	<Card title="Light replica" icon="sun">
		`pmesh setup replica`
		<p>
			Light replica of a mesh, holds a copy of the state to serve locally, but does not participate in elections. This
			is useful for read-only replicas or for servers that are not always online.
		</p>
	</Card>
	<Card title="Client" icon="laptop">
		`pmesh setup client`
		<p>
			Used for clients that want to connect to the services on the mesh, but do not participate in the topology. This
			can be used for any ephemeral service that needs to connect to the mesh, or if you wish to run the NATS.io server
			yourself.
		</p>
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Under the hood

The configuration you provide is used to setup the NATS cluster which are typically quite a bit more [cumbersome](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/clustering/jetstream_clustering).
For starters, NATS will reject to run a cluster of size one or two, and will not tolerate any fault in the network until you have at least three nodes.

To take care of this, pmesh uses a fork of the project with the necessary changes to make it work out of the box.
Additionally, the NATS configuration is generated automatically, placing the servers nearby in the same cluster, and connecting the rest using supercluster gateways.
It will also update itself as you connect new servers so this becomes a set-and-forget operation.

## Example

Let's setup a new server as a seed server using the interactive setup command for our local development environment.

```sh
pmesh setup
```

<script
	async
	id="asciicast-FLKkf1hCdF0hguuTfbttO5mPi"
	src="https://asciinema.org/a/FLKkf1hCdF0hguuTfbttO5mPi.js"
></script>

## Changing the configuration

The setup command will create a `settings.json` file in the `~/.pmesh` directory. To make changes or fetch a value, you can use the `pmesh get` and `pmesh set` commands.
