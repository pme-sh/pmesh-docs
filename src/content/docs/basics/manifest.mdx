import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Now that we have a basic understanding of the template, let's take a look at the format of the manifest file.

```yaml
# Root directory of the project
root: .

# Root directory of the services
service_root: packages

# A map of services
services:
  frontend: !Pnpm
	 lb:
		strat: round-robin
		state: none
		404:
		  limit: 1/s block_after=2/s block_for=10m
		  handle:
			 - log "hi"
	 cluster: 50%
	 monitor:
		test:
		  "front-page-test": GET / 200
  cdn: !FS
	 path: ./static

# A map of virtual hosts
server:
  example.com, example.local:
	 router:
		- example.com/static/: cdn
		- example.com/: frontend

# IP information provider
ipinfo:
  disable: false
  maxmind: "123456"
  mark:
	 - "Cloudflare"

# A map of environment variables
env:
  MY_ENV: "hello"

# A map of runners
runners:
  webhook.:
    content: http
    route:
      - frontend

# The JetStream configuration
jet:
  obj:
	 myobj:
	 	Description: "My Object store"
  streams:
	 mystream:
	 	stream:
			Name: "My Stream"
			Subjects: ["test.*"]
			MaxAge: 1h
			MaxBytes: 1GB
		consumers:
			myconsumer:
				Durable: true
				Deliver: all
				AckPolicy: explicit
				MaxAckPending: 100
  kv:
	 mykv:

		TTL: 1h
		Storage: file

# A list of hostname to IP mapping
host:
  - api.test.local

# The path to custom error pages
custom_errors: ./errors
```

We'll explore some of these fields in detail in the following sections. But for now let's go through the basics of each field.

## Root and Service Root

The `root` field is the root directory of the project, any relative paths in the manifest file are resolved relative to this directory.
The `service_root` field is the root directory of the services, as such if you have the following structure:

```yaml
root: ./a
service_root: b
```

A service with the name `c` will be expected to reside under `./a/b/c`.

## Services

The `services` field is a map of services, where the key is the name of the service and the value is the service configuration.
The configuration differs based on the type of service, but the common structure is as follows:

```yaml
services:
  # Service name
  frontend: !Pnpm # Service type
    # Service configuration, differs based on the service type
    lb:
      strat: round-robin
      state: none
      404:
        limit: 1/s block_after=2/s block_for=10m
        handle:
          - log "hi"
    cluster: 50%
    monitor:
      test:
        "front-page-test": GET / 200
   cdn: !FS
     path: ./static
```

## Virtual Hosts

The `server` field is a map of virtual hosts, where the key is the name of the virtual host and the value is the virtual host configuration.
You may use a comma separated list of hostnames to define multiple hostnames for a single virtual host.

Currently the configuration supported is as follows:

- `no_upgrade` - Disable automatic HTTPS upgrade (`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1`)
- `router` - A list of routers to use for the virtual host

It is very minimal since the more complex configurations are defined in the routers themselves, which we will cover in the following sections.

```yaml
server:
  # Virtual host name
  example.com, example.local:
    no_upgrade: true # Disable automatic HTTPS upgrade
    router:
      - ...
      - ...
```

## Runners

The `runners` field is a map of runners, where the key is the topic it subscribes to and the value is the runner configuration.

- `route` - The router to use for the task, same as the virtual host router
- `content` - The content type for the task, e.g. `application/json` or the special `http` for request representation
- `method` - The HTTP method for the task, e.g. `GET` or `POST`
- `schedule` - The schedule for the task
- `timeout` - The timeout for the task
- `nak_delay` - The delay before NAKing a message
- `rate` - The rate limit for the task
- `serial` - Whether to process messages serially
- `oneshot` - Whether to terminate after the first message
- `no_meta` - Whether to include metadata in the request
- `verbose` - Whether to log verbose messages

We will cover the details of this in the runners section.

## JetStream Configuration

The `jet` field is the JetStream configuration, which lets you define the JetStream objects you want available in the server.

- `streams` - A map of JetStream streams and their consumers
- `kv` - A map of JetStream key-value stores
- `obj` - A map of JetStream object stores

For more details on this please refer to the JetStream documentation.

## Hosts

If you use `example.local` in the manifest, it will be automatically inserted into the hosts file, but the same is not true for the subdomains,
as wildcards are not supported in the hosts file.

The `hosts` field is used to assist you in this regard, where you can define a list of hostname to IP mapping, that will be inserted into the hosts file similar to the `example.local` entry.

```yaml
hosts:
  - api.test.local: 123.123.123.123
  - env.test.local # This will map to 127.0.0.1 implicitly if no IP is provided
```

## Environment Variables

The `env` field is a map of environment variables, where the key is the name of the environment variable and the value is the value of the environment variable.

```yaml
env:
  MY_ENV: "hello"
```

This will set the environment variable `MY_ENV` to `hello` for every child process.

## IP Information Provider

The `ipinfo` field is used to define the IP information provider, which is used to resolve the details of incoming requests.

- `disable` - Whether to disable the IP information provider
- `maxmind` - The MaxMind license key to use
- `mark` - A list of ASN names to mark specially

## Custom Error Pages

The `custom_errors` field is used to define the path (relative to the root) to custom error pages, which will be used instead of the default error pages.
The files supported are `4xx.html`, `5xx.html` and `internal.html` for pmesh internal errors.

```yaml
custom_errors: ./errors
```
