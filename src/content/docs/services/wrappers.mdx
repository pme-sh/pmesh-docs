pmesh provides a set of builtin wrappers around the `App` type we discussed earlier, to make it easier to run and build commonly used languages and frameworks.
As they wrap the `App` type, any configuration that can be used in the `App` type can also be used in these wrappers.

## Node.js Applications

For plain Node.js applications, you can use the `Js` service. Which just runs the `index.js` file using `node`.

```yaml
myapp: !Js
  index: src/server.js
```

## Npm Packages

For applications that use npm, pnpm, or yarn, you can use the `Npm`, `Pnpm`, or `Yarn` services.
These services will automatically detect the package manager, install the dependencies, build and run the applications.

One downside of `npm run <script>` is that it will first launch a shell to run the npm command, which in turn will launch the underlying command as a child,
and then node will finally be launched as a grandchild of the original command. This can lead to a lot of unnecessary processes, resource usage, and making it harder to manage the process.

With builtin support for package.json parsing, pmesh will try to escape the script command and avoid using `npm run` if possible.
For instance, if the `start` script defined in the package.json is `tsx myapp.ts`, pmesh will:

- First, try resolve the `tsx` package in the global and local module repositories to run `node --import file://.../tsx myapp.ts`.
- If not possible, try resolving the `tsx` executable in the command line path to run `tsx myapp.ts`.
- As a last resort, fall back to `npm run start`.

```yaml
myapp: !Yarn
  start_script: start
  build_script: build
  no_install: false
```

### `start_script`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `start`

The script to run using `npm run <script>`. You can also set it to `none` to disable running the script.

### `build_script`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `build`

The script to run using `npm run <script>` before starting the application. You can also set it to `none` to disable running the script.

### `no_install`

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

If set to `true`, it will not install the dependencies before running the application.

## Python Applications

For Python applications, you can use the `Py` service. It will automatically create a virtual environment, install the dependencies, and run the application.

```yaml
myapp: !Py
  requirements: requirements.txt
  main: app.py
```

### `requirements`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `requirements.txt`

The path to the requirements file.

### `main`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `app.py`

The main file to run.

## Flask Applications

For Flask applications, you can use the `Flask` service. It will automatically create a virtual environment, install the dependencies, and run the application.

```yaml
myapp: !Flask
  requirements: requirements.txt
  main: app.py
```

Configuration is the same as the `Py` service, but it will also set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to the main file, and run the `flask run` command.
It will also set the `FLASK_RUN_HOST` and `FLASK_RUN_PORT` environment variables to the host and port assigned.

## Go Applications

For Go applications, you can use the `Go` service. It will automatically build and run the application.

```yaml
myapp: !Go
  main: main.go
```

### `main`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `main.go`

The main file to build and run.
