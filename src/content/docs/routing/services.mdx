Finally, we have reached the last section of the routing, which is the `services` section.
Now that all the middleware has been applied, the request is ready to be sent to the service.

## Named services

The services we define in the `services` block register as named handlers in the router, so we can just call them by name in the router.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - api.site.com/:
        - api # This will call the service named `api`
```

## Beacons and publishing

The alternative to forwarding the request to a service directly is to use the `beacon` and `publish` directives.
This will instead send a message to the message broker, which can be picked up by a runner, as we will be exploring later.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - event.site.com/:
        - publish webhooks.event # This will publish the request to the `webhooks.event` topic and make sure it is delivered.
    - telemetry.site.com/:
        - beacon task.sentry # This will send a beacon to the `task.sentry` topic, but will not make the request wait.
```

The main difference between `beacon` and `publish` is that:

- a `beacon` is a fire-and-forget message with no delivery guarantee.
- a `publish` on the other hand will make sure the message is delivered before returning a response to the client.

The `event.site.com` route above will publish to the `webhooks.event` topic and make sure it is delivered before returning a `200 OK` response to the client.

The `telemetry.site.com` route on the other hand will publish to the `task.sentry` topic, but issue `202 Accepted` immediately.
