Directives can be thought of "commands" that are applied if the router gets to a certain point.
They are used to control the flow of the router including the ability to redirect, cancel, or modify the request.

## debug, log, warn, err

These directives are used to log messages to the console. They are useful for debugging and monitoring the router.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - debug "This is a debug message"
    - log "This is a log message"
    - warn "This is a warning message"
    - err "This is an error message"
```

## proxy-host

This directive is used to change the host of the request. This changes the `Host` header of the request before it is proxied.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - proxy-host "example.com"
```

## path

The `path` directive is used to change the path of the request. This changes the `Path` of the request before it is proxied.
Note that although proxy-host will not affect the router, path will.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - path /new-path
    - site.com/new-path: log "Hit new path"
```

The above example will change the path of the request to `/new-path` which will always hit the `site.com/new-path` route.

## path-join

The `path-join` directive is used to change the path similar to `path` but it will do so relative to the current path.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - path /new-path
    - path-join ./sub-path
```

The above example will change the path of the request to `/new-path/sub-path`.

## path-ljoin

The `path-ljoin` directive is used to change the path by performing a left join with the current path.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - path /new-path
    - path-ljoin /sub-path
```

The above example will change the path of the request to `/sub-path/new-path`.

## path-trim

The `path-trim` directive is used to trim the path of the request. This will remove the suffix from the path.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - path /new-path
    - path-trim /new-path
```

The above example will change the path of the request to `/`.

## path-ltrim

The `path-ltrim` directive is used to trim the path of the request. This will remove the prefix from the path.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - path /new-path
    - path-ltrim /new-path
```

The above example will change the path of the request to `/`.

## header, proxy-header

The `header` directive is used to set a header on the response, while the `proxy-header` directive is used to set a header on the request.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - header "X-Header" "Value"
    - proxy-header "X-Header" "Value"
```

## add-header, add-proxy-header

The `add-header` directive is used to add a header to the response, while the `add-proxy-header` directive is used to add a header to the request.

Difference between `header` and `add-header` is that `header` will replace the header if it already exists, while `add-header` will add the header to the existing headers.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - header "X-Header" "Value"
    - add-header "X-Header" "Value2"
```

This will result in the `X-Header` header having the value `Value, Value2`.

## del-header, del-proxy-header

The `del-header` directive is used to delete a header from the response, while the `del-proxy-header` directive is used to delete a header from the request.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - del-header "X-Header"
    - del-proxy-header "X-Header"
```

## rewrite

The `rewrite` directive is used to rewrite the request path. It is used to change the path of the request before it is proxied.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - rewrite /hi/(.*) /hello/$1.txt
```

The above example will change the path of the request from `/hi/there` to `/hello/there.txt`.

## status

The `status` directive is used to set the status code of the response, and then abort the request.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - status 404
```

## return

Similar to `status`, the `return` directive is used to set the status code of the response, and then abort the request.
But it also allows you to set a message in the response.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - return 404 "Not Found"
```

## redirect

The `redirect` directive is used to redirect the request to another URL.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - redirect "https://example.com"
```

## abort

The `abort` directive is used to abort the request, which will reset the connection.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - abort
```

## drop

The `drop` directive is used to drop the request from the current mux.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - site.com/hi/:
        - site.com/hi/there: drop
        - return 200
    - return 404
```

In the above example, if the request is `/hi/there`, it will be dropped and the response will be `404`, whereas `/hi/mark` will return `200`.

## internal

The `internal` directive is used to mark the route as internal.
This is used to prevent the route from being accessed directly, and can only be accessed from within the router and from a local request.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - internal
```

## allow-internal

The `allow-internal` directive is used to allow internal requests to access the route.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - allow-internal
    - internal
    - return 200
```

with the above example, the route can only be accessed from within the router and from a local request, but since we have `allow-internal`, it will allow bypass this restriction.

## portal

Generally, from within a router, you are not allowed to change between virtual hosts.
The `portal` directive is used to allow you to 'portal' to another virtual host, and additionally mark the request as internal.
This may cause a restart loop if not used correctly, so use with caution.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - portal https://example.com
example.com:
  router:
    - internal
    - return 200
```

In the above example, if the request is to `site.com`, it will portal to the `example.com` virtual host and return `200`.
But if the request is to `example.com`, it will be `403` because it is marked as internal.

## write-timeout, read-timeout

The `write-timeout` and `read-timeout` directives are used to set the write and read deadlines of the response.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - write-timeout 30s
    - read-timeout 5s
```

## auth

The `auth` directive is used to set basic authentication on the route.

```yaml
site.com, site.local:
  router:
    - auth Realm root:1234
```
