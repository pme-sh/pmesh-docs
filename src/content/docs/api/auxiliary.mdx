The API exposes various endpoints for performing auxiliary operations, such as signing URLs and retrieving information about IP addresses.

## Sign URL | `/sign`

| Parameter | Type                 | Description                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`     | `string`             | Arbitrary URL the request should match to be considered valid. |
| `expires` | `datetime?`          | The expiration time of the signed URL.                         |
| `headers` | `map[string]string?` | Headers required to pass verification.                         |
| `secrets` | `map[string]string?` | Headers set after verification.                                |
| `rewrite` | `string?`            | Internal route used after verification.                        |

Generates a signed URL based on provided parameters, including optional headers and expiration time.
Once verified, signed URLs will enable access to [internal](/api/intro/#authentication) resources, so it is important to keep the router associated direct and secure.

The result is a string encoded signature that can be used to access the resource. It should be either set as a header `X-PSN` or appended to the URL as a query parameter `psn`.

To demonstrate, let's sign a URL that resolves to our `hi.txt` file. The path in the signed URL is allowed to be any arbitrary path.

```bash
$ curl http://assets.myapi.local/hi.txt
hello

$ curl -X POST http://pm3/sign -d "{\"rewrite\":\"http://assets.myapi.local/hi.txt\", \"url\":\"http://myapi.local/get-hi\", \"expires\":\"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z\"}"
"jANCSmJioBsYg4vPIh4QftuEaDib21onug2K1rHg-PDWLzJb_DLsNFr2WjswQNFnowvbZTAmO2EmAkTXL2I"

$ curl http://myapi.local/get-hi?psn=jANCSmJioBsYg4vPIh4QftuEaDib21onug2K1rHg-PDWLzJb_DLsNFr2WjswQNFnowvbZTAmO2EmAkTXL2I
hello

$ curl http://myapi.local/get-hi -H "X-PSN: jANCSmJioBsYg4vPIh4QftuEaDib21onug2K1rHg-PDWLzJb_DLsNFr2WjswQNFnowvbZTAmO2EmAkTXL2I"
hello
```

## IP Information | `/ipinfo`

Retrieves information about a given IP address, including ASN, description, country, and flags.

The request expects:
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `ip` | `string` | The IP address to lookup. |

The result is an object with the following structure:
| Result | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `ip` | `string` | The requested IP address. |
| `asn` | `uint32` | The Autonomous System Number associated with the IP. |
| `desc` | `string` | Description of the ASN. |
| `country` | `string` | The country code where the IP is located. |
| `flags` | `uint32` | Various flags providing additional information about the IP. |

Example usage:

```bash
$ curl http://pm3/ipinfo -d '{"ip":"8.8.8.8"}'
{
  "ip": "8.8.8.8",
  "asn": 15169,
  "desc": "GOOGLE",
  "country": "US",
  "flags": 0
}
```
