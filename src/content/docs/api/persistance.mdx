For convenience, pmesh exposes a simple REST API for interacting with the persistence layer. Allowing you to interact with the key-value store, publish events and requests, and retrieve the results of operations.

## Get Key `GET /kv/:key`

Retrieves the state of a specific key within the session's key-value store.

The result is an object with the following structure:
| Result | Type | Description |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| `revision` | `uint64` | The revision number of the key. |
| `value` | `any` | The value associated with the key. |

```bash
$ curl http://pm3/kv/exampleKey
{
  "revision": 42,
  "value": 4
}
```

## Set Key | `PUT /kv/:key`

Sets or updates the value of a specific key. If `revision` is specified, the update will be conditional on matching the provided revision.

The result is the new revision number of the key.

```bash
$ curl -X PUT http://pm3/kv/exampleKey -d '{"revision":42, "value": 4}'
42
```

## Delete Key | `DELETE /kv/:key`

Deletes a specific key from the key-value store.

```bash
$ curl -X DELETE http://pm3/kv/exampleKey
```

## List Keys | `GET /kv`

Retrieves a list of all keys in the key-value store.

The result is an array of key names.

```bash
$ curl http://pm3/kv
["exampleKey1", "exampleKey2", ...]
```

## Atomic Swap | `/kv/:key/cas`

Performs an atomic compare-and-swap operation on a specific key. The operation will succeed if the current value matches the `expected` value, updating it to the `desired` value.

The result is an object with the following structure:
| Result | Type | Description |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `ok` | `bool` | Whether the operation succeeded. |
| `diff` | `any` | The difference between expected and actual value in JSON-diff format, if the operation failed. |
| `revision` | `uint64` | The new revision number of the key, if the operation succeeded. |
| `value` | `any` | The new value of the key, if the operation succeeded. |

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://pm3/kv/exampleKey/cas -d '{"expected": 4, "desired": 5}'
{
  "ok": true,
  "diff": "",
  "revision": 43,
  "value": 5
}
```

## Publish Request | `/publish/:topic`

Publishes an NATS request to a specific topic. The body is the raw event payload and the result is the response from the subscription.

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://pm3/publish/greet.people -d '{"name": "world"}'
{"stream":"ev", "seq":5189}
```

## Retrieve Result | `/result/:stream/:seq`

Fetches the result of a specific operation identified by a stream and sequence number.

The result is the value associated with the operation.

```bash
$ curl http://pm3/result/exampleStream/42
{"operationResult":"success"}
```
