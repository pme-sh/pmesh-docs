The pmesh server exposes a special virtual host `pm3` that can be used to access the internal API of pmesh.

Apart from a few special endpoints, most of the endpoints under the `pm3` can be accessed either through HTTP or Websockets with JSON RPC.
They accept parameters as JSON objects in the body of the request, and the response will also always be a JSON object.

If performance is a concern, we recommend using Websockets as it can handle around twice the requests.

```js
// HTTP
await (await fetch('http://pm3/ping')).json()
=> 'myhostname'

// Websockets
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://pm3/connect')
ws.onmessage = (e) => console.log(JSON.parse(e.data))
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ id: 1, method: '/ping', params: [] }))
=> { id: 1, result: 'myhostname', error: null }
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ id: 2, method: 'POST /ping', params: [] }))
=> { id: 2, result: 'myhostname', error: null }
```

Additionally, for debugging purposes, you can add the query parameter `?pretty` to the URL to get a pretty-printed JSON response where applicable.

## Authentication

Any connection coming to the pmesh HTTP/HTTPS server will either be considered `Internal`, or `External`.
Internal connections are the ones that are able to access privileged resources, such as the `pm3` host or any endpoint marked internal by you using the [internal](/routing/directives/#internal) directive.

The classification of a client connection is done via a simple set of rules:

1. If the connection comes from a loopback address (127.0.0.0/8), it is considered `Internal`. For this reason, you should never put pmesh behind another reverse proxy.
   But if you really have to, the proxy should **ALWAYS** set the `X-Forwarded-For` header to the original client IP address.
2. Next, if the connection comes from a secure connection (HTTPS), and the SNI is `pm3`, the client certificate is checked. If the certificate can be verified and is issued by the pmesh Internal CA, it is considered `Internal`.
3. Otherwise, the connection is considered `External`.

If your server wants to make a request to another server on the network, it will be using the hop endpoints which will handle the TLS and authentication; meaning you will generally use local `http://pm3/...` for everything, including requests to other servers on the mesh.

## Non-confirming Endpoints

:::note
This section is about the special endpoints that do not conform to the standard RPC protocol.
The headers and the method may be significant, and the response may be in a different format than the rest of the API.
:::

### Hop | `/hop`

The hop endpoint is a special endpoint that is used to make requests to other servers on the mesh network.
It is used to handle the authentication and IP resolution for the server you are trying to reach.

The hop endpoint is available at `http://pm3/hop/:peer/:host/:path` where:

- `:peer` is the name or the machine ID of the server you want to reach.
- `:host` is the hostname of the original request.
- `:path` is the path as is.

For demonstration, let's make a request to the `/ping` again, but this time through the hop endpoint.

```js
await (await fetch('http://pm3/hop/myhostname/pm3/ping')).json()
=> 'myhostname'
```

### NATS Monitoring | `/nats`

While not being a part of the pmesh API, the NATS monitoring endpoint is also available under the `pm3` host.
You can access the NATS monitoring endpoint at `http://pm3/nats/...` to get the current state of the NATS server.

To get more information, you can refer to the [NATS documentation](https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/monitoring).

### Go pprof | `/debug/pprof`

The pprof endpoint is a special endpoint that is used to get the runtime profiling information of the pmesh server.
It is available at `http://pm3/debug/pprof/...` and is used for debugging purposes.

### Log tailing | `/tail`

The tail endpoint is a special endpoint that is used to get the logs of the pmesh server.
Instead of an RPC endpoint, it is a streaming endpoint that sends the logs as they are generated in `application/stream+json` format.

The argument to the tail endpoint is a JSON object with the following properties:

| Property     | Type     | Description                    |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `domain`     | string   | Domain to filter logs in       |
| `level`      | string   | Level filter                   |
| `after`      | datetime | Time filter                    |
| `before`     | datetime | Time filter                    |
| `substr`     | string   | Substring filter               |
| `line_limit` | int      | Max lines to emit from history |
| `io_limit`   | int      | Max bytes to read in history   |
| `follow`     | bool     | Follow logs in real time       |

### Header debugging | `/debug/headers`

The header debugging endpoint is a special endpoint that is used to get the headers of the request as they are received by the pmesh server at the specific point in the routing process.

The return value is a text response with the details of the request.

```bash
$ curl http://pm3/debug/headers -H "X-Test: 1"
GET /debug/headers
User-Agent: [curl/8.4.0]
Accept: [*/*]
P-Asn: [AS0 Local]
X-Ray: [0057b2440ed282da-MYH]
X-Forwarded-Proto: [http]
P-Internal: [1]
P-Ip: [127.0.0.1]
P-Ip-Geo: [XX]
X-Test: [1]

```

### Lambda API | `/lambda`

import { LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Lambda APIs are special endpoints used to make a service function or closure universally addressable and invocable.
