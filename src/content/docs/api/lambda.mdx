Lambdas are a special construct in pmesh that enable 1:1 communication between services located on different nodes without the facilitation of the message broker.

The ability to create universally accessible and invocable functions is a powerful feature that can be used to create a wide variety of applications.

One such example is push notifications on a web page. By creating a lambda associated with each browser window, the server can send messages directly to the browser without the need for a message broker.

This reduces the responsibility of the message broker to simply storing 16-byte keys which can be used to directly call the handler without the need for retry logic or durable storage.

## Listing local lambdas | `/lambda`

To list all registered lambdas, simply make a GET request to the `/lambda` endpoint.
The result is a map of all registered lambdas, with the key being the lambda id and the value being the lambda object.
| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | The unique identifier of the lambda |
| timestamp | string | The time the lambda was created |
| code | string | The codec of the lambda |
| headers | map[string][]string | The headers of the lambda registration request |

```bash
$ curl http://pm3/lambda?pretty
{
  "rhowRuuCUoE5vlcA": {
    "id": "rhowRuuCUoE5vlcA",
    "timestamp": "2024-03-09T04:38:57.413+01:00",
    "code": "json-rpc",
    "headers": {
      "Connection": [
        "Upgrade"
      ],
      "P-Asn": [
        "AS0 Local"
      ],
      "P-Internal": [
        "1"
      ],
      "P-Ip": [
        "127.0.0.1"
      ],
      "P-Ip-Geo": [
        "XX"
      ],
      "Sec-Websocket-Extensions": [
        "permessage-deflate; client_max_window_bits"
      ],
      "Sec-Websocket-Key": [
        "mgKWjJUEOA2Fw87w8YC2nQ=="
      ],
      "Sec-Websocket-Version": [
        "13"
      ],
      "Upgrade": [
        "websocket"
      ],
      "X-Forwarded-Proto": [
        "http"
      ],
      "X-Ray": [
        "0057be39815282ea-MYH"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Calling a lambda | `/lambda/:id/:method`

To invoke a lambda, we simply call the `/lambda/:id/:method` endpoint with the payload as the request body.
Response will be the result of the lambda invocation.

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://pm3/lambda/rhowRuuCUoE5vlcA/test -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\" }"
{"echo":{"hello":"world"}}
```

## Creating a Lambda | `/lambda/new/?:id`

To create a new lambda, we need a client capable of Websocket communication.
The client should connect to the `/lambda/new` endpoint and wait for the `open` message, which contains the lambda id.
After the lambda is opened, the client will receive messages in the form of JSON-RPC 1.0 requests, which should be responded accordingly.

The ID parameter in the endpoint is only used if the client is re-opening a lambda. If there is no prior identifier, the client should omit this parameter.

You can see an example of the messages exchanged between the client and the server below.

```js
// pmesh informs the client that the lambda is ready to receive messages and it's UID.
<- {"method":"open","params":["rhowRuuCUoE5vlcA"],"id":0}

// The client accepts the state and informs the server that it's ready to receive messages.
-> { id: 0, result: 'ok' }

// pmesh relays a request to the client
<- {"method":"test","params":[{"hello":"world"}],"id":1}

// The client responds with the result of the request
-> { id: 1, result: { echo: { hello: 'world' } } }
```

For a complete implementation of a lambda client using Node.js and the `ws` package, see the example below.

```ts title="lambda.ts"
import { WebSocket, createWebSocketStream } from "ws";

// Creates a new lambda, returns the ID.
async function newLambda(handler: Record<string, (body: any) => any>): Promise<string> {
	// Create a websocket stream to the lambda endpoint
	const duplex = createWebSocketStream(new WebSocket("ws://pm3/lambda/new"), { encoding: "utf-8" });

	// Define the message handler
	async function handle(id: any, method: string, body: any) {
		let resp;
		try {
			resp = { id, result: await handler[method](body) };
		} catch (error) {
			resp = { id, error: `${error}` };
		}
		duplex.write(JSON.stringify(resp));
	}

	// Return a promise that resolves to the lambda ID when the lambda is opened
	return new Promise(async (resolve) => {
		// For each message received:
		for await (const message of duplex) {
			const { method, params, id } = JSON.parse(message);

			// A special case for the "open" method, which is sent when the lambda is opened to inform
			// the client that the lambda is ready to receive messages and it's UID.
			if (method === "open") {
				// Accept the state and resolve the promise
				duplex.write(JSON.stringify({ id, result: "ok" }));
				resolve(params[0]);
				continue;
			}

			// Handle the message
			handle(id, method, params[0]).catch(console.error);
		}
	});
}

const id = await newLambda({
	test(body) {
		return { echo: body };
	},
});
console.log("id", id);
// id rhowRuuCUoE5vlcA
```
