pmesh builder is triggered when a service is being started. It is responsible for building the service and its dependencies for the first time, or when the service has changed.

When a service is started, first the builder is triggered to build the service and its dependencies.

<Steps>

1. Service start is triggered by user
2. **Hash**

   The builder walks the directory containing the service, following the `.gitignore` rules, and hashes all files after stable sorting. This hash is used to create a _build id_.

3. **Cache**

   The build id is used to check if the service already has its artifacts in the cache. This is done by reading the `.run/.buildid` file (if it exists) and comparing it to the build id we just calculated.

   <FileTree>

   - .build-00024697…
     - .buildid 🤔 compared to the result
     - app-old.js
   - .run 🔗 .build-00024697…
     - ...
   - app-new.ts #️⃣ hashed

   </FileTree>

4. **Build**

   If there is a mismatch, the builder will create a new directory, `.build`, write the build id to `.buildid` and execute the build process as specified in the manifest.

   <FileTree>

   - .build-00024697…
     - .buildid
     - app-old.js
   - .build 🔨 Active build directory
     - .buildid
     - app-new.js ✨ Created by the build steps
   - .run 🔗 .build-00024697…
     - ...
   - app-new.ts

   </FileTree>

5. **Archive & Clean**

   If successful, the final `.build` directory is renamed to `.build-{timestamp}` and the `.run` directory is symlinked to the new directory.
   This is an atomic operation, so the service will not be affected by the change.

   If there are more than two archived builds, the old instances are removed.

   <FileTree>

   - .build-00024697… 🗄️ archive #1
     - .buildid
     - app-old.js
   - .build-00024700… 🏃‍♂️ current build
     - .buildid
     - app-new.js
   - .run 🔗 .build-00024700… (✏️ updated)
     - ...
   - app-new.ts

   </FileTree>

   Previous build is kept as a backup in case the new build is not healthy, and to ensure there is no downtime during the startup process.

6. **Start, Validate & Swap**

   The service is then started using the `.run` directory, once it becomes heathy, old instances are gracefully stopped and loadbalancer is updated.

</Steps>

This process is designed to be fast, reliable and simple to integrate with existing build steps.

- The static `.build` name requires no pmesh specific integration other than changing the output directory.
- Similary, the static `.run` directory ensures the service can be started without any communication with the builder.
- Archiving process is atomic and does not require any additional coordination, the running service is not affected by the change as only the symlink is updated.

Unlike a traditional CI, every server is responsible for building its own artifacts. For this reason you should always make sure that the build process is deterministic and reproducible, or
at least that the user-facing artifacts are the same across different servers.

## Integrating with pre-existing CI/CD

If you wish to integrate pmesh with your existing CI/CD, you can simply have a post-build step that sends the `/repo/update` request to the cluster once the acceptance tests have passed.
